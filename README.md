# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è  
This project demonstrates how to read a file, modify its content, and write the modified version to a new file while handling errors gracefully.  

## Features ‚ú®  
- Reads a file specified by the user  
- Handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be accessed  
- Modifies the file content (converts text to UPPERCASE by default)  
- Writes the modified content into a new file prefixed with `modified_`  

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è  
1. The program asks the user for the filename.  
2. If the file exists, it reads the content.  
3. The text is converted to uppercase.  
4. The program creates a new file named `modified_<original_filename>` and saves the changes there.  
5. Errors like **file not found** or **permission denied** are caught and displayed to the user.# Week-4_Python-Assignment_File-Handling
